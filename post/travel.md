## Travels during my internship abroad
I wanted to take in as much as I could when I had the privilege to intern at Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance under the COVAX Facility. This pushed me out of my comfort zone, urging me to travel solo when I can and practice my French skills that had unfortunately deterioated with time. It was a rewarding experience, but at times, challenging. Because of these obstacles, I indulged in my little wins. Having the opportunity to engage in the slightest conversations with locals in Annecy about fishing or experiencing the religious pilgrimage in Fatima as an agnostic or exploring Dublin's social scene with my new friend. While I intended for this opportunity to push me to grow professionally, I didn't anticipate the personal growth that came with but I'm forever grateful.
